# Value at Risk (VaR)- Historical Method

This project implements the **Historical** approach to estimate the Value at Risk (VaR) of an equally weighted multi-asset portfolio using Python.

It leverages actual historical return data to calculate VaR without assuming any specific distribution, providing a non-parametric estimation of potential portfolio losses.

## üìä Portfolio Composition

The portfolio consists of the following ETFs:

- **SPY** ‚Äì S&P 500 ETF
- **BND** ‚Äì Total Bond Market ETF

## üìå Methodology

- Fetches 15 years of daily price data
- Calculates daily log returns and constructs an equally weighted portfolio
- Computes rolling 5-day portfolio returns
- Sorts historical returns to determine empirical quantiles corresponding to different confidence levels
- Estimates VaR directly from the historical distribution of returns
